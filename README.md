# The journey so far...
## Python:
- Everything in this programminng langauge is an Obect.  Just like many other programming langauges knowing how to declare variables types and functions is important.  I need to improve in this area as well as with using comments more often.

- Hit the ground running hard here throughout the first few weeks.  Learning programming concepts and fundamentals.  Still need to work on some of the labs to include the use of functions and classes.  Also, need to go through just to make sure the issues are worked out with the functionality of each lab and versions.

## HTML and CSS:
- Followed along with several tutorials.  Currently following the Jekyll tutorial to develop a Portfolio page that is hosted by Github. THe link is (jstnhmltn/github.io).  Dont expect much. As of now, this is just a 'Hello World' page.
- Ive messed around with HTML and CSS from some previous courses and honestly not my strongest passion.  However, I do understand the importance of being able to captivate an audience with a nice UI and "pretty" fonts, images, animations, color schemes... 

## Django:
- Decent learning curve here.  I have read through the PDXCodeGuild docs on Django several times.  From what I understand so far is that Django is a web development framework that is wrttien using Python.  It allows for quick web development because much of the back-end directories are already prepared for routing.
- I understand this is not the most important aspect of full-stack development, but in my case I need to improve my understanding of Request Response Cycle.  It's very easy to get lost in this section.

## Javascript:
- So far I don't think even ready to get into the Javascript.  I started reading through the documentation from PDXCodeGuild docs.  I understand this is a large chunk of development as a whole.  variables are declared with var and let.  Then in the HTML we use <script></script> tags either in the header or the footer.

*made this markdown file just to take a break from trying to understand the routing and queries needed for Django* 

*probably a better idea to do this sort of thign in a blog in the HTML section.*
